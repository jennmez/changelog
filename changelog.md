# My Coding Journey, Among Other Things

This is a change log of my own personal development updates. Some entries may be related to :computer: coding projects, some to :school_satchel: classes and conferences I'm virtually attending, some :books: books I'm reading and maybe a glimpse of some :art: art-related projects that help me unwind. My goal is to help create visibility and accountability to forming good habits as I continue growing professionally and personally. Since I came across this idea later in my journey, this log is less detailed as of the April and will be more detailed moving forward. It is not a full description of what I have been working on or built up to this point.

Credit where credit is due! Thanks David Walton @djwalto for sharing this idea on LinkedIn.
