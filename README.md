# My Coding Journey, Among Other Things

This is a change log of my own personal development updates. Some entries may be related to :computer: coding projects, some to :school_satchel: classes and conferences I'm virtually attending, some :books: books I'm reading and maybe a glimpse of some :art: art-related projects that help me unwind. My goal is to help create visibility around my current professional and personal growth, and form better habits through accountability. I came across this idea as of early October so unfortunately, it is not a full description of what I have been working on.

Credit for this idea goes to a network friend, David Walton @djwalto . Thanks for sharing this idea!
